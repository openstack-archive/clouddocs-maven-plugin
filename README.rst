Introduction
============

This project is the Rackspace/OpenStack customization of the Docbkx
plug-in for creating documentation artifacts for Rackspace, OpenStack,
and other OpenStack projects.

Example output
==============
Rackspace output: 

- http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/content/Overview-d1e70.html

OpenStack output:

- http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/
- http://api.openstack.org/api-ref.html

OpenStack source files:

- https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals/tree/master/doc/user-guide/src
- https://github.com/openstack/api-site/tree/master/api-ref


Test changes to clouddocs-maven-plugin
======================================

Note: When you commit, be sure you are on a branch,
do a single commit, and do "git review" instead of pushing.

To test changes to clouddocs-maven-plugin on your local machine:

#. Run this command to clone clouddocs-maven-plugin:

        git clone git@github.com:stackforge/clouddocs-maven-plugin.git

#. CD into the clouddocs-maven-plugin directory.

#. Edit the pom.xml file and set the version number on line #11 to include -SNAPSHOT.
   For example, 1.12.1-SNAPSHOT.

#. Make changes to clouddocs-maven-plugin.

#. Run this command to build clouddocs-maven-plugin locally:

        mvn clean install

#. Run this command to clone the api-site:

        git clone git@github.com:openstack/api-site.git

#. CD into the api-site directory.

#. Edit the pom.xml file and set the version number on line #42
   to the same version number as in the clouddocs-maven-plugin pom.xml file.
   For example, 1.12.1-SNAPSHOT.

#. Run the following command to build the api-site locally:

        mvn clean generate-sources -U

   The -U switch picks up the local build of clouddocs-maven-plugin.

   - Avoid "The value of param status.bar.text must be a valid Java Object" errors.
   - Support sectionLabelIncludesComponentLabel in autopdf.

   - Fix bug where appendix.autolabel wasn't being passed in to auto-generated pdfs from pom.
   - Fix bug where xslts weren't found in the target directory when building doc from a parent pom.

   - Wadl processing: Avoid "7th argument of concat cannot be a sequence" error which happens when you have a response with multiple representation/@element nodes. 

clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.6.0 (November 10, 2012)
============================================================

-  Automatically handle images: 

   -  Detects if images are missing from a document and fail if an
      image is missing. You can turn off this validation by setting
      <strictImageValidation>false</strictImageValidation> in your
      pom.xml.
   -  For Webhelp output, automatically converts .svg to .png.
   -  Automatically copies images to the Webhelp output directory.

-  Automatically build pdf when building webhelp and copy pdf to
   webhelp directory unless <makePdf>false</makePdf> is set in your
   pom.xml.

   -  Generate pdf file names in the format basename-20121110.pdf where
      basename is the base pdf name and 20121110 is the taken from
      /*/info/pubdate in the document. If the pdf is generated with a
      security value other than external, then put the security value
      in the pdf file name. For example,
      basename-internal-20121110.pdf.
   -  For Rackspace branding, by default the link to the pdf is
      changed to basename-latest.pdf to provide a permalink to the
      latest pdf. Our landing page dynamically redirects to the file
      name of the current pdf. To avoid this behavior and have the pdf
      link in webhelp be to the actual pdf, set \
      <useLatestSuffixInPdfUrl>0</useLatestSuffixInPdfUrl>.

-  Provide better error messages if incorrect DocBook version is used
   (i.e. if DocBook 4.x is used instead of 5.x).
-  Updated Rackspace logo.
-  Move profiling to early in the pipeline. This fixes bugs where
   content in title and revhistory weren't being profiled.
-  Fix bug where IDREFs weren't validated.
-  Support passing in -Dsecurity=internal|external|reviewer and
   -Ddraft.status=on|off from the command line.
-  Generate .war file version of webhelp with bookinfo.xml file to
   support autopublish to landing page. To generate a war you must set
   webhelp.war. Typically this will be done from the Jenkins job that
   builds for autopublishing (-Dwebhelp.war=1).
-  It is no longer necessary to add ids to every <resource> in a wadl
   to use the point-to-wadl method of including content from a wadl.
-  Validation changes:

   -  Documents are now validated twice. Post xinclude, the documents
      are validated without checking IDREF integrity. Documents are
      validated again after wadl inclusion. At this time IDREFs are
      checked.
   -  When a validation error is detected, a copy of the invalid
      document is now stored in the /tmp directory with a name like
      /tmp/invalid-2012-10-14T11:21:14.913-05:00.xml

- Generate war version of Webhelp output when webhelp.war=1.
- Added support for a Repose branding (see http://openrepose.org/).
- Bugfix: In PDF output, quote chapter names instead of italicizing them. 
- Bugfix: IDREFs are validated now during the build.

clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.5.0 (November 6, 2012)
============================================================
-  Improve the way Google Analytics is called. 

clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.5.0 (August 14, 2012)
============================================================
-  Support build-time search and replace via a configuration file. To
   use add a parameter like the following to your pom.xml:
   <replacementsFile>replacements.config</replacementsFile> Where
   replacements.config is a file in the same directory as your
   pom.xml. See the example replacements.config file for documentation
   on how to use it.

clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.4.0 (August 13, 2012)
============================================================
- Chinese fonts now supported in pdf output.
- WADL2DocBook: Fixed bug where query params were copied down the WADL
  tree.
- Removed reference to tabpress.com js file which was not loading
  causing pages not to load. Unfortunately, this disables all social
  icons for now.
- Added support for a secondaryCoverLogoPath param that allows the
  user to specify a second logo that appears on the bottom left of the
  pdf.
- Fixed bug where cross-references were not resolved correctly in the
  revision history table.
- Fixed bug where parameters were omitted in some cases. 

clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.3.1 (May 30, 2012)
============================================================

New features and changes
------------------------

-  You can now control the size of the status bar text:
   ``<?rax status.bar.text.font.size="50px" status.bar.text="LIMITED AVAILABILITY"?>``.
   The default size of the text is about 71.3px, so if you need it
   smaller go from there. 50px should work for "LIMITED AVAILABILITY".
-  When generating DocBook from wadl, if you spin as
   <security>writeronly</security>, at the top of each generated section
   it shows what wadl the method came from and what the method id is.
-  You no longer need to pre-normalize wadls when using wadl2docbook.

   a space character.
-  Enabled automatic glossary generation for pdfs.
-  Fixed the generation of ids on generated wrapper sections in
   wadl2docbook.
-  In certain cases, code listings with callouts had extra line breaks
   added.

   was not working.
-  When you clicked on a link to an anchor within a page, the heading
   was partially hidden by the banner.

---------

-  Bug fixes in syntax highlighting:

   -  Now support manually inserted <co> style callouts.
   -  Now support markup inside programlistings, etc.
   -  Added "Select" button to code listing to make it easier to know
      how to select the code sample.

      single file.
   -  Adjusted formatting to avoid problems when many callouts appear in
      one listing.

-  Webhelp

   -  Fix bug where searches with quotes return no results.

=============================================

New features and changes
------------------------

-  Syntax highlighting and line numbering for code samples for supported
   languages (bash, xml, json, javascript, json, and others to be
   added).

   -  Use the language attribute on the programlisting, literallyout,
      and screen to indicate the programming language used in the code
      sample. Supported languages currently include:

      -  bash
      -  xml
      -  javascript
      -  json
      -  python
      -  java

-  Extensions documents are automatically generated when extensions
   information is included in the book/info element.

   -  An example of how to use this feature is available in the
      following pull request
      `https://github.com/RackerWilliams/rax-compute-extensions/pull/1 <https://github.com/RackerWilliams/rax-compute-extensions/pull/1>`_

-  The target of the "Legal notices" link is now configurable so that
   the user can set the ``legalNoticeUrl`` parameter in the pom.
-  The socialIcons parameter is now tied to the security parameter so
   that it is impossible to generate a document that is both internal
   and contains socialIcons.

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fixed bug where the title in webhelp was incorrect when a doc
   contained multiple releaseinfo elements.

      to the email address to which you would like notifications sent
      when a page is commented on.
   -  As an alternative to ``<feedbackEmail>`` in the pom, you can put
      ``<?rax feedback.email="someemail@rackspace.com"?>`` as a child of
      book in the document.
   -  You can also put a comma-delimited list of emails if you want more
      than one person to be notified.

      for details.

Impacts to current projects
---------------------------

-  Projects can have a <glossary> section, which is like a <chapter> or
   <appendix>. This can have glossary entries that give definitions.

   the terms and a popup box will appear when the user rolls over the
   term in webhelp. See `Adding Glossary
   Popups </display/RED/Adding+Glossary+Popups>`_ for details.
-  You can set ``<branding>openstackextension<branding>`` in your POM
   file. When you do, there will be a different page header and cover
   page. Also, Disqus comments will be stored in the OpenStack forum.

clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.0.5 (20 September 2011)
================================================

New Features
------------

-  Initial support for wadl2docbook processing which allows you to
   include wadl or pointers to a wadl in your DocBook file and have the
   wadl processed into human readable output.

   -  To support this, a wadl framework has been added to the Rackspace
      Oxygen customizations. This framework helps you author wadls,
      providing interactive error checking and other assistance.
   -  Also in Oxygen, the Rackbook schema has been modified to allow
      wadl markup in DocBook documents.

-  Support for disqus\_identifier. (This will be used when the document
   is deployed. The writers don't have to do anything.)
-  Ability to separate or include Disqus comments for different versions
   of a document.
-  xml:id required on book, chapter, part, sections
-  Support for formatting ``<parameter role="template">`` as a wadl
   template parameter (i.e. surrounded by curly braces) in Oxygen and
   the output formats.
-  The arrow and check mark images are now available in the common
   images directory.

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fixed bug where ``webhelp.default.topic`` was not being used when set
   in the pom.

Impacts to current projects
---------------------------

-  The xml:id attribute is now required on all book, chapter, section,
   appendix etc. elements. This ensures that in webhelp output we will
   have stable urls.

   -  If you want to build your document and ignore this requirement,
      you must turn off Disqus. Set the enabledisqus variable to 0 like
      this:

      ::

          436503a2577e475a980a335f2943376355facd00
          <enableDisqus>0<enableDisqus>

-  If you want Disqus to use a different thread for different versions
   of your document, use this setting in your POM:

   ::

       <useVersionForDisqus>1<useVersionForDisqus>

-  Support for parameter that controls whether the url or a unique
   disqus id is used to associate comments with content. If you set
   ``<useDisqusId>0</useDisqusId>``, then it omits using the Disqus
   identifier. It turns out that this feature was unnecessary since
   comments that were associated via url are still associated with the
   document after adding the Disqus identifier.

clouddocs-maven-plugin 1.0.4 (09 June 2011)
===========================================

New features and changes

   ``<enableDisqus>intranet</enableDisqus>`` is set.

   docs.rackspacecloud.com and using target="\_blank" in links.

   information in the toc pane.
